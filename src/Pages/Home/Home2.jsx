            The Space Biology Knowledge Engine helps students, researchers, and
            scientists explore how life can survive beyond Earth. It uses NASA
            data on plants, microbes, animals, and humans tested in space and on
            Earth under conditions like microgravity, radiation, and lunar soil.
            You can search, filter, and visualize experiments, such as how lettuce
            grows on the Moon or how radiation affects mouse tissues.

            For students, itâ€™s a learning tool to understand space biology. For
            researchers and scientists, it provides data to design experiments and
            find new insights. Its mission is to turn space biology data into
            knowledge for living on the Moon, Mars, and beyond.
